# PRML-DataContest
Machine Learning Competition


Here we built a prediction model for members of Biker-Interest-Group and tried to predict which bike-tours will be of interest to bikers. we also used all the extra information provided, such as biker's previous interests, his/her demographic details, past tours, friend circle etc. This dataset is derived from a real world scenario; so we took care of sanitizing/handling real data.

To learn about the bikers, we had access to their feature information and friends-network. Information regarding tours and its participants was also available. We used the data in creative ways to come up a ML model that predicts bikers preference among tours.
